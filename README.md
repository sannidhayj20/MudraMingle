# MudraMingle
MudraMingle uses Flask, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and CVZone to uncover Bharatanatyam's heart—the mudras. Employing machine learning, it interprets these vital hand gestures, essential to the classical dance form
MudraMingle is an innovative project focused on leveraging machine learning (ML) to delve into the art of Bharatanatyam through mudras—traditional hand gestures integral to this classical dance form. This Flask-based application employs computer vision using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and CVZone to detect and interpret various mudras made by the dancer's hands. The real-time visualization of recognized mudras assists in learning and practicing the intricate gestures involved in Bharatanatyam, providing insights into their meanings and significance.


**Key Features**:

Real-time hand gesture recognition using computer vision techniques.
Detection and visualization of Bharatanatyam mudras on a live webcam feed.
Analysis and interpretation of recognized mudras with detailed descriptions.
Email functionality to share detected mudras and practice sessions.
Usage:
The application utilizes a Flask web server to display the webcam feed and recognize hand gestures. Users can visit the web interface to interact with the system, explore detected mudras, and practice Bharatanatyam mudras with real-time feedback.
